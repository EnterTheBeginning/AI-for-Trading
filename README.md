**Dropout:** Buffed in all areas of body rather than one hand.

Weights get **buffed**. Randomly we turn off the notes so other nodes take up
the process.

Dropout = at each epoch 0.2 each node gets off and on average will make sure all
the nodes are

Vanishing gradient:

Problem Tiny changes on weights. Never able to find minimum.

Solution: ReLU,
